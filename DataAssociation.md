Data Association:


Linking the one Model to Another Model with the help of their Unique Id

e.g : 

You have 2 models
1. User
2. Post


so, what happens as user create post it's obvious,
so when post is created then it is from the user side.

To ham kya krte ha jab do aise data apas mein closely related hote ha to ham dono ko jod dete ha.

To kaise jodte ho ap ?

Ans : to ham kya krte ha jab user bnta ha to uski ek id hote ha or ham us id ko doosre model joke hmara post name se ha usko de dete ha aur POST MODEL ki id ham USER MODEL ko de dete ha



So this is data association.


SO implementation

1st step: Create two models

2nd step : Create a Route jisme ek user banjaye
